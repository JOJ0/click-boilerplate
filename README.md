# Click Boilerplate
Boilerplate project for a the Python Click library. This code can serve as a starting point for your project.
To use it, rename the `cli_app` module to the name of your project and update the `setup.py` to reflect these 
changes.

## Using this boilerplate

In order to use this boilerplate, I recommend doing the following:

- Change the name of the `click_cli` module to something that is relavant to your project
- Update the `setup.py` file, pointing the `console_scripts` option to the updated module name
- Update the `setup.py` file with other values relevant to your project
- Remove the `hello` command and start replacing with commands for your project
